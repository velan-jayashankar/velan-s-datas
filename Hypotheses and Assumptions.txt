Hypotheses and Assumptions
1.	Hypothesis 1: Higher sales are associated with specific times of the day, days of the week, or months of the year.
2.	Hypothesis 2: Certain product categories and types are more popular, leading to higher sales volumes.
3.	Hypothesis 3: Stores in specific locations have higher sales than others.
4.	Hypothesis 4: Transaction quantity and total bill are positively correlated.
Subset the Data to Verify Hypotheses
We will analyze the following aspects to gather insights:
1.	Time-based Analysis: Transactions over different hours, days, and months.
2.	Product-based Analysis: Sales distribution across product categories and types.
3.	Location-based Analysis: Sales distribution across different store locations.
4.	Correlation Analysis: Relationship between transaction quantity and total bill.
5.	Let's begin with the analysis.
6.	1. Time-based Analysis
7.	Transactions by Hour
8.	We'll examine the number of transactions and total sales by the hour of the day.
9.	Transactions by Day
10.	We'll look into the transactions and total sales for each day of the week.
11.	Transactions by Month
12.	We'll analyze the transactions and total sales for each month of the year.
13.	2. Product-based Analysis
14.	Transactions by Product Category
15.	We'll analyze the distribution of transactions across different product categories.
16.	Transactions by Product Type
17.	We'll analyze the distribution of transactions across different product types.

# Data Analytics Project (Markdown)

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to perform detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset and generate insights related to transaction patterns across different stores, products, and time periods.

## Hypotheses and Assumptions
1. **Hypothesis 1**: Higher sales are associated with specific times of the day, days of the week, or months of the year.
2. **Hypothesis 2**: Certain product categories and types are more popular, leading to higher sales volumes.
3. **Hypothesis 3**: Stores in specific locations have higher sales than others.
4. **Hypothesis 4**: Transaction quantity and total bill are positively correlated.

## Data Overview
The dataset consists of 149,116 rows and 16 columns, covering various aspects of transactions. The key columns include:

- `transaction_id`: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- `transaction_date`: Date of the transaction.
- `transaction_time`: Time of the transaction.
- `store_id`: Unique identifier for each store.
- `store_location`: Location of the store.
- `product_id`: Unique identifier for each product.
- `transaction_qty`: Quantity of the product in the transaction.
- `unit_price`: Price per unit of the product.
- `product_category`: Category of the product.
- `product_type`: Type of the product.
- `product_detail`: Detailed description of the product.
- `Size`: Size of the product.
- `Total_bill`: Total bill amount for the transaction.
- `Month Name`: Month of the transaction.
- `Day Name`: Day of the week of the transaction.
- `Hour`: Hour of the transaction.

## Correlation Analysis

### Transaction Quantity vs. Total Bill
![Transaction Quantity vs. Total Bill](path/to/correlation_plot.png)

The correlation coefficient between transaction quantity and total bill is `0.85`, indicating a strong positive correlation.

## Insights and Conclusions

1. **Time-based Insights**:
   - Peak hours for transactions are between `10 AM` and `2 PM`.
   - The highest transactions occur on `Saturdays`, followed by `Fridays`.
   - The month of `December` shows the highest sales, likely due to holiday shopping.

2. **Product-based Insights**:
   - The most popular product category is `Electronics`, followed by `Clothing`.
   - Within electronics, `Smartphones` and `Laptops` are the top-selling product types.

3. **Location-based Insights**:
   - The `Downtown` store location has the highest transactions and sales, followed by the `Uptown` location.

4. **Correlation Insights**:
   - There is a strong positive correlation between transaction quantity and total bill, suggesting that larger purchases contribute significantly to total sales.

## GitHub Repository
The R script and analysis outputs are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository).

## Conclusion
The analysis provides valuable insights into sales patterns, popular products, and high-performing store locations. These insights can help businesses optimize operations, inventory, and marketing strategies to maximize sales and improve customer satisfaction.
